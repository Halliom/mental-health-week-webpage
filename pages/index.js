					<h2>What is Mental Health Week?</h2>
					<p>
						We believe that solutions happen when we start sharing
						whatâ€™s going on in our minds to friends, family and even
						strangers. Mental Health Week is the place where you can
						share your story of mental health challenges and learn
						without any fear or restriction. A series of lectures
						and activities on a different theme every day, where
						everyone is welcome whether you are seeking help or if
						you are curious about Mental Health issues.
